This README explains how to compute limits using the higgs combine tool with condor. See twiki entry:
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/SWGuideHiggsAnalysisCombinedLimit#Computing_the_expected_limit_hyb

There are two parts to computing limits using toys. The first part is to throw toys using various values of signal strength, creating a "grid". This first step is done with condor. The second step uses the toys to actually calculate the expected limit.

NOTE: The libHiggsAnalysisCombinedLimit.so file was created with modifications to the source in order to suppress very large log files that get sent to /tmp by combine. These log files now get sent to /dev/null.

Follow these steps to compute expected limits:

1. source setup.sh
   This sets up the environment

2. ./prepareCondor.sh
Modify the INDIR and OUTDIR variables appropriately. This script creates a directory containing everything necessary to submit condor jobs. This script calls do_one.sh which runs asymptotic limits to get the +/- 1 sigma bands to use as bounds for the signal strength grid. getGridPoints.C creates a txt file containing a list of signal strengths for each signal point. The default is 10 signal strength points, modify getGridPoints.C to change this.

3. cd to directory created in step2, then do ./writeAllConfig.sh
Modify the VERSION variable in writeAllConfig.sh appropriately. nJobsPerGridPoint, nToysPerJob, nIterationsPerJob control the statistics and run time of the jobs. By default jobs are submitted to T2_US_UCSD,T2_US_Nebraska,T2_US_Wisconsin,T2_US_MIT,T2_US_FLORIDA, modify writeConfig.sh to change this.

4. ./submitAll.sh
Submits all the condor*.cmd condor configurations created above.

5. Wait for condor jobs to finish...

6. ./merge_grid.sh
Modify the INDIR and OUTDIR variables appropriately. This script merges all the grid points for a signal into a single root file that's used in the final step to actually compute the limit.

7. ./doLimits.sh
Modify the CARD_DIR and GRID_DIR variables appropriately. This script does the limit calculation and stores the result in a txt file.
